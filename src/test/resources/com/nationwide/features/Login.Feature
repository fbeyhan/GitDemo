Feature: Login
  Agile story:
   As a user,
   when I enter valid login credentials
   I should be able to see the dashboard page

  Scenario Outline: Login as different account types
    Given user is on the landing page
    Then user clicks on Log in
    And user verifies that "Log in for Insurance & Investments â€“ Nationwide" page title is displayed
    And user selects "<account type>"
